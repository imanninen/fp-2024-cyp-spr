# HW05
## Deadline: 23:59 12.03.2024

1. (1 point) Make your solution of HW04 into a stack project.
2. (1 points) Replace the associative list with a `Map` from `Data.Map.Strict` in the `containers` package.
3. (4 points) Replace your hand-written test suite with a `tasty` test suite. Ensure good coverage.

If you start working on this assignment before I've finished checking your HW04 assignment, you can switch to a project in HW04 branch. This way you won't need to synchronize between branches. No need to create HW05 and open PR in this case either.
